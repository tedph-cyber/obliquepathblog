# The Power of Copy-Paste Development

In the modern web development landscape, efficiency is key. The ability to quickly implement features without reinventing the wheel can make the difference between shipping on time and falling behind schedule.

## Why Copy-Paste Matters

Traditional component libraries lock you into their implementation choices. When you need to customize something, you're fighting against the library's abstractions. With shadcn/ui's copy-paste approach, you're in control from day one.

## Building Accessible Web Applications

Accessibility should never be an afterthought. When you copy a component from shadcn/ui, you're getting battle-tested, accessible markup that follows best practices.

### ARIA Labels

Every interactive component includes proper ARIA labels:

```tsx
<button
  aria-label="Close dialog"
  aria-describedby="dialog-description"
>
  <X className="h-4 w-4" />
</button>
```

### Keyboard Navigation

All components support keyboard navigation out of the box:

- **Tab** - Move focus between interactive elements
- **Enter/Space** - Activate buttons and links
- **Escape** - Close modals and dropdowns
- **Arrow keys** - Navigate menus and tabs

### Semantic HTML

Components use semantic HTML elements that screen readers understand:

```tsx
<nav aria-label="Main navigation">
  <ul>
    <li><a href="/">Home</a></li>
    <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
  </ul>
</nav>
```

## Real-World Examples

### Building a Dashboard

Start with a layout component:

```tsx
import { Card, CardContent, CardHeader, CardTitle } from "@/components/ui/card"

export default function Dashboard() {
  return (
    <div className="grid gap-4 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4">
      <Card>
        <CardHeader>
          <CardTitle>Total Revenue</CardTitle>
        </CardHeader>
        <CardContent>
          <p className="text-2xl font-bold">$45,231.89</p>
        </CardContent>
      </Card>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Creating Forms

Use accessible form components:

```tsx
import { Label } from "@/components/ui/label"
import { Input } from "@/components/ui/input"
import { Button } from "@/components/ui/button"

export default function ContactForm() {
  return (
    <form>
      <div className="space-y-4">
        <div>
          <Label htmlFor="email">Email</Label>
          <Input 
            id="email" 
            type="email" 
            placeholder="you@example.com"
            required
          />
        </div>
        <Button type="submit">Submit</Button>
      </div>
    </form>
  )
}
```

## Testing Accessibility

Always test your components with:

1. **Keyboard only** - Can you navigate without a mouse?
2. **Screen reader** - Does it make sense when read aloud?
3. **Color contrast** - Are colors distinguishable for everyone?
4. **Zoom levels** - Does it work at 200% zoom?

## Performance Benefits

Copy-paste components mean you only ship what you use. No bloated bundle sizes with unused code. Your users get faster page loads and better performance.

## Conclusion

The copy-paste approach isn't just about convenience—it's about building better, more accessible, and more maintainable applications. Start copying, start building, and ship faster than ever before.
