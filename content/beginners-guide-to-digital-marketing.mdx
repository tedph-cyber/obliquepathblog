# The Beginner’s Guide to Creating a Simple Digital Marketing Strategy That Actually Works

Starting a digital marketing effort can feel overwhelming. You know your small business or startup needs it to grow, but when you sit down to plan, you’re faced with endless options: social media platforms, email tools, ads, SEO, content creation—and no clear path forward. Many founders end up scattered, trying a little of everything, and seeing little return.

The good news? You don’t need a complex, 50-page plan or a big budget to see real results. What you need is a **simple digital marketing strategy** that focuses on what actually moves the needle for your business.

At **Oblique Path**, we’ve helped dozens of small businesses and startups cut through the noise with straightforward, effective plans. Our philosophy is simple: **clarity over complexity**. Effective marketing isn’t about doing more—it’s about doing the right things consistently.

In this beginner’s guide, we’ll walk you through a proven **5-step framework** to create a digital marketing strategy that works, even if you’re starting from scratch.

## Why Most Marketing Strategies Fail for Small Businesses

Small business owners are busy. You’re wearing multiple hats, and marketing often gets squeezed in between everything else. Unfortunately, this leads to some common pitfalls that derail even the best intentions.

### The most common reasons strategies fall flat:

- **Trying to do everything at once**  
  You set up profiles on Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, Facebook, Pinterest… and quickly burn out trying to post everywhere.
- **Chasing trends without purpose**  
  A new platform goes viral, or you see a competitor running ads, so you jump in—without asking if it fits your audience or goals.
- **No clear goals from the start**  
  Without defined targets, it’s impossible to know what’s working or where to focus effort.

The consequences are predictable: money wasted on tools and ads that don’t convert, time spent creating content no one sees, and eventual frustration that leads to abandoning marketing altogether.

The fix isn’t more effort—it’s **better direction**. A focused, simple digital marketing plan prevents these issues and delivers measurable growth.

## The 5-Step Oblique Path Framework

This framework is designed specifically for small businesses and startups. It’s straightforward, actionable, and built to produce results without overwhelming you.

---

## Step 1: Define Your Core Business Goals

Everything starts here. Before choosing tools or creating content, get crystal clear on what you want marketing to achieve.

Ask yourself:

> *In the next 6–12 months, what are the top 1–3 outcomes that matter most?*

### Common realistic goals include:

- Increase monthly revenue by a specific amount (e.g., $5,000)
- Generate a consistent number of qualified leads (e.g., 20 new inquiries per month)
- Build brand awareness in your local market or niche
- Grow your email list to a target size

Write your goals using the **SMART framework** (Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, Time-bound).

**Example:**  
> Generate 15 new client inquiries per month through the website within 6 months  

This is far better than “Get more customers.”

---

## Step 2: Understand Your Audience Deeply

You can’t market effectively if you don’t know who you’re marketing to.

Create a basic **buyer persona**—a semi-fictional profile of your ideal customer.

### Answer these key questions:

- Age, location, job title, income level  
- Biggest challenges or pain points related to your product or service  
- Where they spend time online (specific platforms, websites, communities)  
- What kind of content they consume (videos, blogs, podcasts)  
- What motivates them to buy  

You don’t need fancy tools. Start with your existing customers—who’s already buying from you? Talk to them. Look at your sales data. Even **3–5 short customer interviews** can reveal powerful insights.

**Template tip:** Keep it to one page with sections for demographics, goals, challenges, and preferred channels.

---

## Step 3: Choose the Right Channels

Here’s where most beginners go wrong: they spread themselves across too many platforms.

Instead, pick just **2–3 channels** where your audience already hangs out and where you can show up consistently.

### Examples:

- **Local service businesses** (plumber, salon, gym):  
  Google Business Profile, Facebook, and email
- **B2B businesses** (software, consulting):  
  LinkedIn and email
- **Ecommerce brands targeting younger consumers:**  
  Instagram and email

**Rule of thumb:** Master one or two channels before adding more. Consistency on a few platforms beats sporadic effort everywhere.

---

## Step 4: Create a Content & Promotion Calendar

Now that you know your goals, audience, and channels, plan what you’ll actually publish—and when.

A simple content calendar keeps you consistent without overwhelm.

### Start with these content types:

- **Educational content** that solves problems (blogs, videos, guides)
- **Promotional content** that highlights offers (case studies, testimonials, deals)
- **Engagement content** that builds community (questions, polls, behind-the-scenes)

Use a basic tool like **Google Sheets** or **Trello**.

**Suggested columns:**  
Date | Channel | Content Type | Topic | Status

### Example monthly rhythm:

- **Week 1:** Publish one in-depth blog post or video  
- **Week 2:** Share 3–4 social posts linking to that content + original tips  
- **Week 3:** Send one email newsletter with value + soft promotion  
- **Week 4:** Run a small promotion or lead magnet campaign  

Keep it realistic. Start with **4–6 pieces of content per month**.

---

## Step 5: Measure and Refine

Marketing isn’t set-it-and-forget-it. You need simple metrics to track progress and make smart adjustments.

### Beginner-friendly metrics to track:

- Website traffic (Google Analytics – free)
- Email list growth and open rates
- Lead or form submissions
- Social media engagement (likes, comments, shares)
- Revenue or inquiries tied to marketing efforts

Review results monthly and ask:

- What’s working?
- What isn’t?
- What should we double down on?

This iterative approach turns your strategy into a **growth engine** over time.

## Real-Life Example: A Local Coffee Shop

**Brew & Bean**, an independent coffee shop, wanted more foot traffic and repeat customers but had no real marketing plan.

### How they applied the framework:

- **Goals:**  
  Increase weekend foot traffic by 30% and grow email/SMS list to 1,000 subscribers in 6 months.
- **Audience:**  
  Local professionals (25–45), families, college students who value quality coffee, cozy atmosphere, and community.
- **Channels:**  
  Instagram, Google Business Profile, and email/SMS.
- **Content Calendar:**  
  - Daily Instagram stories  
  - 3 feed posts per week (drinks, staff, events)  
  - Weekly email with special offers  
  - Regular Google updates  
- **Measurement:**  
  Foot traffic counter, email sign-ups at register, and offer redemptions.

### Results after 6 months:

- Email list grew to 1,200  
- Weekend traffic increased by 38%  
- More repeat customers mentioning promotions  

All with **less than 5 hours per week** of marketing.
